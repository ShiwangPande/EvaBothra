Among my friends, I'm known as the \"dadi\" of the house, the one they turn to for perspective, advice, and the occasional reality check. If I had to describe myself in three words, they would be grit, anti-fragile, and wise beyond my years.",
        fullStory: "My friends once said the song that captures me best is 'Fight Song,' and honestly, I think that fits. Life has never felt like a smooth road; it's felt like a fight. But I've never wanted to fight just for myself. I fight for others too‚Äì for fairness, for dignity, for the courage to face what's uncomfortable.\n\nI've lived through experiences that gave me a raw, unfiltered lens on the world. Instead of breaking me, they've made me sharper, hungrier, and more curious. They taught me not just to see problems but to take responsibility for fixing them. And that's what excites me about the future: the chance to learn endlessly, to keep pushing my limits, and to leave behind not just footprints, but real impact.",

I extracted fibers from banana stems, processed rice husks, and combined them using natural binders, experimenting with texture, durability, and flexibility until the material could actually function as leather. Beyond the lab, I approached the project like an entrepreneur: calculating costs, optimizing production steps, and imagining how this material could be scaled for real-world applications.\n\nPresenting before a panel of national experts was both exhilarating and humbling. I learned that science isn't just about invention‚Äîit's about defending your process, explaining your choices, and translating technical complexity into clear, compelling communication. Standing there, I felt the full arc of research: curiosity, experimentation, iteration, and public engagement.\n\nThe IRIS experience was my first true intersection of science and entrepreneurship, showing me how rigorous research can be paired with practical innovation to create solutions that matter.",

Standing frozen in Jaipuria Government Hospital, I realized that sterile wards, steady hands, and safe births‚Äì the things I had taken for granted in Bangalore‚Äì were privileges reserved for a few. Later, talking to baijis who delivered babies on muddy floors or in hospital corridors, I saw how society normalizes its most profound injustices. That moment didn't make me despair‚Äì it made me act.\n\nJanam was born from that urgency. We transform waste shipping containers into mobile birthing centers, combining safety, dignity, and scale. One container is already operational in Mahapura, and two more are underway. Each is fully equipped, designed in collaboration with gynecologists, the National Health Mission, and Aastrika Foundation, and supported by local panchayats. Beyond infrastructure, I trained over 100 midwives, organized health camps for more than 1,500 villagers, and published illustrated pregnancy guides in both Hindi and English to dispel common myths. In partnership with ProtectHer and Suraksha, we conducted cervical vaccination drives and menstrual hygiene programs.\n\nOn the financial side, I raised over $ 12,000 through crowdfunding, CSR partnerships, and grants, managing the allocation of funds across construction, equipment, and educational materials to ensure sustainability.\n\nEvery container, every midwife trained, every rupee spent became more than a statistic‚Äì it became a lifeline. Janam taught me that confronting systemic inequity is not about charity; it's about designing solutions that are practical, scalable, and rooted in dignity. Seeing women access care once denied to them is the reason I fight to transform ideas into real-world change.",

That moment showed me the gap between talent and opportunity.

TeenLink became my answer.\n\nI built the platform from the ground up: coding the app, designing the interface, creating graphics, planning onboarding, and drafting marketing strategies. Late nights debugging, learning from professional coders, and iterating endlessly taught me that real entrepreneurship is persistence in action.\n\nToday, TeenLink has 400 beta users, with a roadmap to reach 20,000 in the next app update. Partnerships with Mauka onboarded 80 NGOs and 56 companies for volunteer work, while over 20 school counselors expanded their mentorship programs. Early funding of ‚Çπ4 lakhs (~$5K) and selection in the TYE Rajasthan accelerator validated the work.\n\nEvery feature, every pitch, every bug fix reflects my drive to transform a gap I experienced firsthand into a platform that empowers thousands of students to discover opportunities and connect with mentors.",

Tasks ranged from organizing community events to distributing resources. More than the technical help, it was the human conversations ‚Äî listening to how people adapted to everyday challenges ‚Äî that stayed with me.\n\nMitrajyothi taught me the value of humility in service: often, what feels like \"help\" from the outside is actually collaboration, building alongside people who already possess extraordinary resilience.",

I organized multi-faith prayer circles that celebrated verses from the Gita, Bible, and Quran, hosted karaoke nights and pizza parties, and led wellness sessions designed to bring residents joy and connection.\n\nAlongside daily engagement, I worked with residents to produce handmade greeting cards and candles, small crafts that generated income while restoring dignity in their labor. I spent time listening to their stories, playing games, and holding space for silence when words were unnecessary.\n\nThrough these activities, I saw how inclusion can be lived: not as charity, but as a matter of dignity and companionship. Asha Niketan taught me that empathy is a practice, not a gesture, and that the most profound impact is often quietly found in shared meals, small creations, and the recognition of humanity in one another.",
