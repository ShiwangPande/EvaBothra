Languages, meanwhile, pushed me to build patience, nuance, and persistence.\n\nIronically, the subjects I'm most proud of are the ones where I didn't receive the top grade ‚Äì Hindi and English. With almost no support in those classes, I had to study independently, building skills from the ground up. Losing the A* didn't discourage me; it lit something sharper in me. I pushed deeper into both languages on my own, and now they're among the areas where I consistently excel. That journey didn't just make me a better student‚Äì it made me a more resilient learner, someone who thrives even when the path isn't clearly laid out.",

The project grew from curiosity-driven experimentation in chemistry and materials science‚Äîconcepts I had first explored during my IGCSE science studies, which taught me to approach problems methodically, observe carefully, and iterate constantly.\n\nUnlike a purely theoretical project, I moved from idea to prototype to production. I extracted fibers from banana stems, processed rice husks, and combined them using natural binders, experimenting with texture, durability, and flexibility until the material could actually function as leather. Beyond the lab, I approached the project like an entrepreneur: calculating costs, optimizing production steps, and imagining how this material could be scaled for real-world applications.\n\nPresenting before a panel of national experts was both exhilarating and humbling. I learned that science isn't just about invention‚Äîit's about defending your process, explaining your choices, and translating technical complexity into clear, compelling communication. Standing there, I felt the full arc of research: curiosity, experimentation, iteration, and public engagement.\n\nThe IRIS experience was my first true intersection of science and entrepreneurship, showing me how rigorous research can be paired with practical innovation to create solutions that matter.",

I built the platform from scratch: coding the website, designing the QR-linked posters, writing and recording audio scripts in eight Indian languages, and creating a workshop manual for volunteers.\n\nI trained and coordinated a 15-member volunteer team to expand into cities across Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Delhi, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Nepal. Over 600 posters were distributed across 60+ factory, construction, and mandi sites in Jaipur, reaching more than 8,500 workers.\n\nEvery resource was vetted by a Supreme Court lawyer, and through a partnership with Citadel Law Solutions, workers gained direct access to pro bono legal counsel. To date, this has led to over 30 active labor rights cases, with follow-up support ensuring a tangible impact in the real world.\n\nLegal Saathi showed me that empowerment doesn't require grand reforms‚Äîsometimes, it's a worker scanning a QR code in their lunch break and, for the first time, accessing previously abstract rights.",

                details: "On a rusted stretcher with paint flaking like ash, my aunt screamed through childbirth with no doctor in sight. Standing frozen in Jaipuria Government Hospital, I realized that sterile wards, steady hands, and safe births‚Äì the things I had taken for granted in Bangalore‚Äì were privileges reserved for a few. Later, talking to baijis who delivered babies on muddy floors or in hospital corridors, I saw how society normalizes its most profound injustices. That moment didn't make me despair‚Äì it made me act.\n\nJanam was born from that urgency. We transform waste shipping containers into mobile birthing centers, combining safety, dignity, and scale. One container is already operational in Mahapura, and two more are underway. Each is fully equipped, designed in collaboration with gynecologists, the National Health Mission, and Aastrika Foundation, and supported by local panchayats. Beyond infrastructure, I trained over 100 midwives, organized health camps for more than 1,500 villagers, and published illustrated pregnancy guides in both Hindi and English to dispel common myths. In partnership with ProtectHer and Suraksha, we conducted cervical vaccination drives and menstrual hygiene programs.\n\nOn the financial side, I raised over $ 12,000 through crowdfunding, CSR partnerships, and grants, managing the allocation of funds across construction, equipment, and educational materials to ensure sustainability.\n\nEvery container, every midwife trained, every rupee spent became more than a statistic‚Äì it became a lifeline. Janam taught me that confronting systemic inequity is not about charity; it's about designing solutions that are practical, scalable, and rooted in dignity. Seeing women access care once denied to them is the reason I fight to transform ideas into real-world change.",

At my old school, I launched a Debate Club from scratch ‚Äì organizing rooms, teachers, logistics, and over 70 members‚Äì only to be told we couldn't compete. That moment showed me the gap between talent and opportunity. Transferring schools revealed a new world of possibilities, and I realized that thousands of students were being denied access to mentorship, internships, and growth opportunities. TeenLink became my answer.\n\nI built the platform from the ground up: coding the app, designing the interface, creating graphics, planning onboarding, and drafting marketing strategies. Late nights debugging, learning from professional coders, and iterating endlessly taught me that real entrepreneurship is persistence in action.\n\nToday, TeenLink has 400 beta users, with a roadmap to reach 20,000 in the next app update. Partnerships with Mauka onboarded 80 NGOs and 56 companies for volunteer work, while over 20 school counselors expanded their mentorship programs. Early funding of ‚Çπ4 lakhs (~$5K) and selection in the TYE Rajasthan accelerator validated the work.\n\nEvery feature, every pitch, every bug fix reflects my drive to transform a gap I experienced firsthand into a platform that empowers thousands of students to discover opportunities and connect with mentors.",

I taught myself video editing and digital promotion, learning to balance authenticity with algorithmic reach. Every thumbnail, caption, and cut became an extension of the message: that dialogue is powerful only when it's accessible.\n\nThrough Reshaping Society, I learned that storytelling isn't just expression ‚Äî it's impact.

The project grew from curiosity-driven experimentation in chemistry and materials science‚Äîconcepts I had first explored during my IGCSE science studies, which taught me to approach problems methodically, observe carefully, and iterate constantly.\n\nUnlike a purely theoretical project, I moved from idea to prototype to production. I extracted fibers from banana stems, processed rice husks, and combined them using natural binders, experimenting with texture, durability, and flexibility until the material could actually function as leather. Beyond the lab, I approached the project like an entrepreneur: calculating costs, optimizing production steps, and imagining how this material could be scaled for real-world applications.\n\nPresenting before a panel of national experts was both exhilarating and humbling. I learned that science isn't just about invention‚Äîit's about defending your process, explaining your choices, and translating technical complexity into clear, compelling communication. Standing there, I felt the full arc of research: curiosity, experimentation, iteration, and public engagement.\n\nThe IRIS experience was my first true intersection of science and entrepreneurship, showing me how rigorous research can be paired with practical innovation to create solutions that matter.",

I invited classmates and peers from other schools to contribute their stories, transforming the site into a shared voice for young people navigating the same challenges and aspirations. Each post became a small act of connection ‚Äî a way for students to see themselves reflected in one another‚Äôs journeys.\n\nThrough this process, I learned more than just web design and writing; I discovered community-building.

                details: "In the stillness of a Jaipur winter, I spent ten days in silence ‚Äî no phone, no books, no conversation, and nearly 1,400 hours of meditation under the guidance of Dr. Renuka Goel, my Vipassana teacher. It was my first sustained experience of complete inward observation, and perhaps the first time I understood the discipline of simply being.\n\nVipassana, as taught in the tradition of S. N. Goenka, is a technique of insight ‚Äî a systematic training of awareness through continuous attention to bodily sensations. From 4:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m., the day unfolded in complete silence. Ten hours of seated meditation, broken only by brief meals and rest, created a rhythm that dissolved the usual boundaries between body and mind. With no clocks, no mirrors, and no eye contact, time lost its familiar weight; what remained was the cycle of breath and the movement of attention.\n\nEach session began with ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅna, observing the breath as it flows in and out ‚Äî not controlling it, just noticing. Gradually, the practice deepened into Vipassana: scanning the body from head to toe, observing sensations ‚Äî heat, tingling, tightness, calm ‚Äî without reaction or preference. The simplicity is deceptive. To sit perfectly still for an hour is to watch the mind's restlessness laid bare. Yet in that repetition lies the heart of the practice: equanimity.\n\nDr. Goel often reminded us that Vipassana isn't about escape or transcendence, but about seeing reality as it is ‚Äî impermanent, interconnected, and constantly changing. Over days, I began to feel that truth not as a concept, but as an experience. A sensation would arise, crest, and dissolve ‚Äî like thoughts, emotions, and memories themselves. Nothing stayed fixed.\n\nWhat Vipassana offered was not peace in the sentimental sense, but clarity ‚Äî a quietness that isn't the absence of noise but the ability to stay undisturbed within it. The silence became a mirror, reflecting how every moment, no matter how fleeting, carries its own completeness.\n\nWhen the ten days ended, the world outside felt louder but lighter. Vipassana didn't change my circumstances; it changed my relationship to them. It taught me that awareness is not passive ‚Äî it's active presence. To observe without resistance is to understand, and to understand is to begin transforming.",
